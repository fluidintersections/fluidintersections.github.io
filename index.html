<p>by Delphilia</p>
<p>I am so excited I actually created a completely 100% free website that I learned how to create
 by watching some youtube videos and doing google searching.  I am so excited because I can just
 publish my thoughts as I learn to code and build my vision of an online community focused on
 teaching "the algorithm".</p>
